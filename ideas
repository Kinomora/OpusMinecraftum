Solver:
Best option: Single block that can be placed. Using the manual you select your desired recipe and right click the solver with the manual. This displays a render of the required atom structure above it and auto-solves

Calcifier:
Idea: Calcifier projects a render X blocks above it, configurable with right/shift right-click, any atom that passes through the render is salted
Idea: any atom that touches any side/the top side of the calcifier is salted

Bonders:
"Sticks" two atoms together that are both on top of the two bonder blocks
block that goes in between to atoms to stick them together

Triplex bonder:
empowers an atom

Duplication - salt = atom:
atom underneath or inside duplicator, any salt that touches the top becomes that atom

Projection - metal + QS = metal + 1 tier:
metal atom on top, QS touches any side or goes inside

Purification - two metals = 1 metal + 1 tier:
similar to Projection

Animismus - two salt = vite and mors:
vite generates on top, mors generates on bottom, salt touching 2 of any other side or 2 salts are inserted
